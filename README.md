# Ekta

Ekta is a design that is based on an expanding brush stroke following a heart line. 

The design is meant to be for long texts but have a certain charm at large sizes.

Ekta is based off the OpenType features found in Pria Ravichadran's Palanquin font. 

Initially the design's widths are heart lines also come from interpreting Palanquin. 

Deviations from Palanquin have begun to appear to find more typical or orthodox shapes or to accomodate the density of the brush.
